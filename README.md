# Spotify-Data-Analysis

# Project Description
In April 2006, Spotify, a Swedish supplier of media services including audio streaming, was established. With over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paying members, it is the largest music streaming service provider in the world.

Here, I've investigated and measured musical data to get important information. We out data cleansing in order to use Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the Spotify dataset. Data analysis includes sentiment analysis and many more techniques to investigate the connection between a song's aural characteristics and how positive or negative its lyrics are. Secondary data from Spotify is used in Spotify Data Analysis. Analyze data to find trends and connections among various attributes. The project will help with the development of the capacity to examine and analyze a dataset.
